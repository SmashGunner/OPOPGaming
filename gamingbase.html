    <h2>What's the Gaming Base?</h2>
    <p>The Gaming Base is the behind-the-scenes space for 〇ヤ〇ヤ. It’s less about combat and more about connection. You’ll find edit drops, meme clips, daily vibes, game recaps, and team life. It’s where raw moments live before they go viral.</p>

  <!-- New My Journey Section -->
  <section class="my-journey">
    <h2>My Journey — From Dreamer to Gamer & Creator</h2>
    <p>
      Every legend starts somewhere, and mine began with a simple love for games and storytelling. From early days spent glued to screens, navigating pixelated worlds, I dreamed of more than just playing — I wanted to create, to inspire, and to build something lasting. The journey wasn’t easy. Balancing school, work, and personal struggles, I learned that passion without discipline fades fast. So I doubled down, learning web and graphic design, mastering editing skills, and pushing my limits every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gaming Base is a reflection of that journey — raw, real, and unfiltered. It’s a place where creativity meets hustle; where late nights aren’t complaints but badges of honor; where each meme, edit, and clip tells a story not just about the game, but about life behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve faced setbacks, felt frustration when things didn’t click, but what kept me going was the community — the ones who watched every drop, the team who fought alongside me, and the fans who believed before I even did. Today, 〇ヤ〇ヤ Gaming Base isn’t just a hub; it’s a home. A place where dreams become plans and plans become reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I keep grinding, I invite you to be part of this story — to witness the wins, the fails, and every step in between. Because at the end of the day, it’s more than gaming — it’s about the journey we share.
